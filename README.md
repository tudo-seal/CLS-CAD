An add-in and matching backend that allows adding types to Joint Origins and Parts in Fusion 360, and allows requesting and assembling results by means of combinatory logic.

When exploring a design space this is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than manual design, and a lot less tiring.

</details>

To get started with the add-in, follow the instructions in the [getting started section](#getting-started).

There is an overview video available at: https://youtu.be/gNqHxLpqiFw <br>
(_Slightly outdated, newest features and performance improvements missing_)

# Installation

---

To install the add-in in Fusion 360, download the [latest installer](https://github.com/tudo-seal/CLS-CAD/releases/download/latest/cls-cad-fusion-plugin.msi) and execute it.
To use the plugin, you need a running backend.
This requires [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) to be installed.
<br>
After installing and starting docker, in a terminal, run:

- `docker run -d -p 8000:80 --name cls-cad-backend --pull=always ghcr.io/tudo-seal/cls-cad-backend:latest`

For subsequent usage, simply start the `cls-cad-backend` container from the containers tab in the docker desktop application.

# Getting Started

---

## Install Add-In

---

Install the add-in using the [latest installer](https://github.com/tudo-seal/CLS-CAD/releases/download/latest/cls-cad-fusion-plugin.msi).
<br>
Please make sure to have started Fusion 360 at least once before installation. The add-in is available as of the next time launching Fusion 360.

## Install Docker and Run Backend

---

Run the backend (using docker, as detailed in the [Installation](#installation) section)
<br>
On subsequent runs after rebooting the PC, the created container shown at the end of the GIF can just be started again.

## Prepare Project for Synthesis

---

Switch to the CLS-CAD tab in Fusion 360, and press the `Upload Taxonomy` button. Select the .taxonomy in the [modular components for synthesizing robotic arms](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10051244).
<br>
Press the `Crawl Project` button in the CLS-CAD tab and wait for the process to complete.

## Request Synthesis

---

At the far right of the CLS-CAD tab, press the `Request Synthesis` button.
<br>
Select the part type `Base` in the upper taxonomy, optionally add constraints, and hit Ok.

# Basic Usage

- Create taxonomies for a project by using the graphical taxonomy editors.
- Place Joint Origins.
- Type the placed Joint Origins.
- Type the parts.
- Submit the parts to the backend.
- Request synthesis.
- Explore and assemble the results.
